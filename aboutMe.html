								<h2>Nicole S. Favours</h2>
								<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my page.</p>
								<p>I could go on speaking about where I was born (Brooklyn) where I've lived (a few places), how old I am (47), but none of that really tells who I am.  I don't think I need to go back that far.</p>
								<p>In 2014 I made the decision to stand on what I believe.  I'm a Christian and while I've always belived God would direct my path and order my steps my ego wouldn't permit me to live it even though I'd seen evidence of it throughout my life.  And so, I said a prayer telling God I wasn't happy.  I didn't know my direction.  This can't be what life ha to offer me.  My job was boring, I've had an admimistrative career my entire adult life.  It had to be more and I wanted Him to lead me to where amd what it was.  I oonly had a few requests.  I didn't want to work in the city anymore.  I had just purchased a car and wanted to be abe to drive to work everyday.  I wanted a salary that was enough to pay all of my bills.  And finally, I didn't want to be miserable.  I told Him that I wouldn't ask questionms, I would go where he sent me.</p>
								<p>The first thing that happened was my father passed.  We didn't even know he was sick.  Him passing put some strains on my living situation but forced me to rely on God because nothing else made sense.  Then the temp job I was working at ended.  Two weeks later I received a call from Brookdale Hospital saying they wanted to interview me for an Executive Assistant role for the CEO of the hospital.  Here's the thing, I never applied for a position with the hospital.  I grew up im nthe neighborhood and that was the one place you not only didn't want to be a patient but you dind't think about working there.  But an EA role was and EA role and I needed to work.</p>
								<p>After an hour long conversation it was decided that there was a different position in the same office that the interviewer thought I would be better suited for, External Affairs.</p>
								<p>Here I am 4 years later.  I've started two companies of my own:</p>
								<li>TruOpulence - an Event Planning Company</li>
								<li>Natural Glory - a Natural Skin Care Company</li>
								<br>
								<p>I've been promoted to Program Manager.  My creative side has been allowed to flourish.  I've been sent to schools to learn Graphic Design and now Web Development.</p>
								<p>I was able to help start an anti-gun violence program called <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2016/10/brooklyn-hospital-gun-violence-morgue/">It Starts Here</a>
								 that received national exposuer on <a href="https://abc7ny.com/education/scared-straight-anti-gun-violence-program-takes-kids-to-morgue/1344599/">ABC News</a>
								 and was honored to receive the <a href="https://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2018/23/wod-nicole-favours-2018-05-25-bk.html">2018 Brooklyn Women of Distinction Award</a>
								.  In other words, I'm still learning who "Me" is.  Who's to ay what this page will be as I apprach the next level</p>
